<!-- "var" is telling the computer to *store* something (computer is digging a little spot for memory), then whatever is after it is what "var" will be refered as that word (in example, var is referred as "message"), whatever is after the equal sign inside the quotes is whats being put into "var" (ex: the hole in var is being filled with "hi Vivek" with the intention of using it afterward) -->
